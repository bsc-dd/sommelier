    "The uniform sample is simple but it has some issues that limit it from being used widely. Queries with group-by such as `SELECT X, SUM(Y), GROUP BY X` can miss groups in the answer, especially those corresponding to values of X that have low support. For such queries, we must use a different kind of sample, such as the distinct sampler which intuitively guarantees that at least a certain number of rows pass per distinct combination of values of a given column set. The distinct sample also helps when aggregates have high skew. When we have skewed data, few rows can contain high values (e.g revenue of a company) in a way that, for a given query that aggregates such values, these rows are crucial to obtain approximate results and hence they should have a higher probability of being selected. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the year 2016, Microsoft presented a system called QuickR that approximates the answer to complex queries by injecting samplers on the fly and without requiring pre-sampled data. Through a cost-based optimizer, they generate query plans with appropriate sample operators at the most adequate location, providing also an accuracy analysis to not miss any little group. The results show that QuickR improves substantially the performance in a large segment of TPC-DS benchmark queries, using a 2x fewer resources in the cluster and with a mean error of only the 10% in aggregations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How did they accomplish that? \n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the queries and taking into account the statistics of the tables, the system decides whether to sample the data or not, and which sampling technique will deliver the most accurate answer. In the paper, they describe the implementation of three different types of sampling techniques, which are already described in the sections above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniform**: All elements have the same probability to be selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Universe**: Picks a p fraction of the values of the columns in a given set; all rows with such value are passed by this sampler. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distinct**: Sampling technique that guarantees all groups in the data  are selected at least a determinate number of times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They also implement logical optimization rules to propagate the operator through projections and joins (left, right, both or none of them) to retrieve less data in early stages of the query. The system also allows exploring confidence intervals and other estimators of individual operators after the query completes, as part of an accuracy analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "An analysis of approximability of big data queries shows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distribution of queries over input datasets is heavy-tailed. Individual queries use many columns and different combinations of columns (in projection/filtering) such that the additional storage space required to store samples can be prohibitively large. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Queries typically have aggregation operators, and output results are by many orders of magnitude smaller than inputs, so they are approximable. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Several factors hinder approximability: queries use a diverse set of columns requiring extensive stratification. Many queries join large input relations. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Queries are deep, involving multiple effective passes over data including network shuffles. "

Finally, an algorithm is triggered to accomplish the user specifications through dynamic sampling percentages. \n",
